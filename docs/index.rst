Welcome to Dieke's Documentation!
======================================

This package aims to be an easy to use and easy 
to install solution for crystal field calculations for the rare earths. 


The best place to start in understanding how to use `Deike` is the :doc:`Pr:LaF3 example <prlaf3example>`, `PrLaF3.py`.
The code for this and others is in the 'examples' directory.
