These datafiles were downloaded from:

http://www.cse.anl.gov/OldCHMwebsiteContent/downloads/data/index.html

The files were still there and the same as these ones (except for the
difference below) 2018-09-03.

 - The file f12mp.dat on that site is corrupted, so I have named it
   "f12mp.dat.broken". I found a 'fixed' copy in the source of Mike
   Reid's linuxemp program and that is here as f12mp.dat.

- But that file was a bit broken so I added "T2 T3" to the end of some
  lines that looked like they needed it!
